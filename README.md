# SAP internship : Machine learning for code analysis, assignment by RaphaÃ«l CATHRINE

## To try my program (developed on WSL 2 ubuntu) you should have :

- an up to date git version
- the python version and libraries required in pipenv the virtual environment in the code folder (include pytest, pyyaml...)

To test it you can use the pipenv environment and run the python script which will print the report, otherwise you can use pytest to try the few test cases.
